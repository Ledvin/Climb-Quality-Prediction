Now all free~ with a well-protected crux~ much Eldorado Canyon-style face climbing on fine rock~ cheek-clenching exposure (or is it fine exposure and cheek-clenching rock?)~ and a classic flat summit. The regular route (the only other route~ on the south side~ has aid and is  likely unrepeated) is a true desert classic~ combining a sense of history and exploration with technical high quality pitches.Start on the northeast corner~ under a big clean dihedral.    1. Scramble over some blocks then jam and stem up the dihedral to the roof. Great gear. This is about 5.9/5.10-. Then awkwardly lurch rightwards under the roof~ a tad harder~ to a blind reach for~ well~ whatever you can grab out on the face. Launch up a short steep wide section (5.10b/c) to easier ground~ where the impacts of so many groping hands and feet~ over the years~ have removed all traces of the traditional kitty-litter.Saunter up to a tiny exposed ledge and fixed anchor. Double ropes help protect this pitch.    2. Comb your hair and brush your teeth for the photo-op traverse. After this rightwards stroll~ launch up a blocky and sustained right-facing system. Again~ two ropes and liberal use of slings here is a good idea on this long pitch. There are several moderate 5.10 boulder problem moves between rests~ then the crack angles up and left past a steep weird section~ then passes a relic of an old fixed anchor. A belay here is possible~ but will be hanging and awkward. Best to boldly keep going up the slowly steepening terrain above. Angle up and left into a squat dihedral~ then exit this up and right. Wires are surprisingly good here~ though be careful to use adequate slings as the placements are often hidden in recesses and funny horizontals. A final funky bulge onto a great ledge completes one of the better trad 5.10 pitches anywhere.    3. The Token Sport Pitch. This has a short but burly overhead-bolt protected 5.11c crux~ just above a nice rest ledge. Actually this is hardly a sport pitch; there is a very funky move off the belay to get onto the rest ledge. Once above the crux~ more steep 5.10 Eldo-style face climbing with wires for gear gains a crappy old bolt and a mantel onto an elephants-ear flake. If the elephant is in a kind mood~ which it usually is~ the flake will stay put~ and you can belly-scrape up onto the next belay ledge. However this elephant appears to have some form of leprosy~ and one day the ear will detach itself. In fact one day the crucial hold at the 5.11c crux will also go south (or north in this case) and this pitch will be rather harder. Once on the ledge~ you can relax~ all the hard climbing is over with~ and while your partner leads the 5.8 glory pitch up and right to the easy finish~ you can lean over the void below and envisage the scene should the whole tower topple. If it did~ it would fall south~ and the climbers would be left with a few seconds of quiet contemplation and a whistle of the wind~ before the end. Maybe~ just before the tower hit the ground~ if you jumped up with enough force~ you could actually land unhurt on the debris.    Wow~ wait a minute~ the ropes are suddenly tugging~ and off you go easily up the last pitch. Or if your partner is Jonny Copp~ he'll not be satisfied with the regular finish~ and you'll find yourself struggling up the direct finish. Hmmm. This wasn't in the script. Hideously awkward mantels and steep face~ very solid 5.11~ lead straight up to the nice new rap bolts. The summit is a very cool place to be~ where the silence is loud~ and everything else is very small.  There is still a register under the cairn~ though the sequence of ascents is pretty hard to figure out anymore due to the assortment of broken pencils~ torn candy-bar wrappers and oddments with odd scrawls. Bring more paper!    For me~ it appears I am competing with one Jimmy Dunn~ who has also been up here four times. The rate of ascents is interesting. Maybe ten or a dozen ascents a year now. One a month. A total of about 100 ascents is my guess. Rap the route. Two 60 meter ropes gain the top of the second pitch. Fron here~ rap to the top of the first pitch~ then again to the ground. Get ready for the drive from hell; it's a loooong way to the Moab Brewery. Kor and Ingalls may have done the first ascent~ but Castleton Tower it ain't.","'A regular rack of cams from small Aliens to #3.5 Friend (maybe two sets) and wires (include RPs) and quickdraws.

The route begins from the same ledge as The Yellow Spur and Vertigo~ and is more or less half way between the direct starts of these two routes.    Go up the Redgarden Wall trail from the Streamside trail until a metal ladder takes you up just beside the large boulder against the wall.  The dihedral just above the ladder on the wall~ behind the boulder~ is Schizophrenia.    Schizophrenia is a 5.8** approach pitch to Psychosis and will deposit you more or less at the base of the route.    If you do not want to climb Schizophrenia~ continue up several switch-backs until a broad ledge appears as for the approach The Yellow Spur.  Cut back S/SW on this ledge at the base of the rock to an impressive looking evergreen (Douglas Fir).  Just down and right of the tree is a weakness in the large roof~ some 15' or so from the ledge.      P1) Climb up and over this roof on small but positive holds with poor protection (10a/b~ S).  This is essentially a mantel move with one high reach.  Short climbers will find this more difficult than those who are tall.  After that sequence~ some gear can be had here and there for the rest of the way up~ the now more moderate pitch.  A belay is reached soon~ as this is a fairly short pitch.    P2) Climb up and left to a junky and nondescript right facing dihedral to a ledge~ which can afford a belay~ the position of which will depend on how you will do the 3rd pitch~ so that is where the belay is described.  Better yet~ don't do this pitch at all and instead do the 2nd pitch of 3 Old Farts Young At Heart (10d) which adds challenge and quality to the line.    P2a) Climb up directly above the belay on P1 through a crack. This crack splits a short dark section of rock which passes through a small roof (crux~ 10d).  This pitch consists of good rock with good gear.     P3) The standard finish of Psychosis.  From the top of P2 ledge~ move up and left on the ledge~ then up again to a good stance to belay.  From the belay~ traverse down and right (5.10d) to a 5.10a handcrack~ which goes to the op of the wall and deposits the climbing party on the top of the upper ramp.  Some people find the traverse frightening due to its position and lack of gear.    P3a) The better finish of Psychosis.  From the top of P2~ arrange the belay as if directly above P2a.  There is an enormous overhanging wall which a handcrack and pockets galore directly above you.  Climb it (5.11a) until the angle eases off to where the standard finish merges with the crack at the end of its traverse.  Continue to the top on the handcrack (5.10a).  There is a little questionable rock on the overhang~ but the holds for the climb and the crack are good and take good gear; it is better and probably safer than the standard finish~ although harder.    From the top of the route~ some length and quality can be added by finishing your day on Italian Arete or Body Tremors.","The protection in some places leaves a little to be desired.  Take a standard Eldo Rack and make sure you have small gear with you. Some of the runouts can be avoided by taking the harder alternate pitches of ""3 Old Farts..."" and the 5.11 finish instead of the 5.10 finish.",86

Intimidation is a full-length route up an intimidating wall and none of the pitches will let you down. This is one of the best multi-pitch 5.10s in NH.    The moderate climbing between the cruxes can be a bit run out~ and though the hard parts can be scary~ they are protected well enough (maybe PG13). The only real R rated climbing is the second pitch traverse and it goes at 5.8.    Pitch one: (5.10b) Start up the moderate ramp system heading toward the corner/crack. Sling two nuts together (I use #10 stoppers) and use them to reach a good high placement before making the moves in to the crack. Without this trick~ the pitch is R rated for sure.   Continue up the corner and gain a well deserved rest and a bolt. The crux in my opinion is making a move left after the bolt using crimps to make a big reach and throwing a heelhook up to mantel. From here~ climb moderately to the 2 bolt anchor.    Pitch 2: (5.8R) Climb up and clip a pin before making a hair-raising traverse left away from your gear. The climbing is slabby and gets harder as you move left until you get a thank god hold. You can then get a marginal placement to protect your second by climbing back above the traverse and placing a cam in a pocket...This gear is not great so don't bring a second that is not solid on 5.8 friction.    Pitch 3: (5.9+) Climb up above and to the right from the tree ledge gaining a thin crack with some tricky moves involving some face climbing. After you reach a good ledge~ continue up a corner to a kick ass right leaning crack that leads to a small stance where you can belay.    Pitch 4:(5.9+) Continue up the right-leaning crack (harder than it looks) and up over a steep section and on to easier climbing. Follow the path of least resistance up and left until you are on a slab with a couple of dikes in it. Some paths up this part are more well protected than others~ so choose wisely your route.

Ascend the easy slab~ aiming straight up for the incipient crack.  This leads to some horizontal seams at the base of the upper sector of the climb; good stances and placements are available here~ before you really start to engage the meaty part of the hand/fist crack.  The bulgy crux is passed as you are moving into the base of the crack; past this lies more sustained 5.8 crack climbing in a sort-of-awkward but fun dihedral that wants to keep pushing you off-balance.    Described and illustrated by Foley (2005:85) and Jackson (2006:70).  Jackson indicates the option to set up an intermediate belay at the base of the crack~ but that is completely unnecessary.  Foley points out a harder exit up the face to the left~ once you're past the crux.    The 1981 guide lists this route as a 5.7.  That description of the climb also splits it into two pitches.  It also mentions a ""bolt~ sans hanger"" on the slab below the crack.  We saw no bolt~ but the older description also sort of suggests that the climb originally angled up and right~ so we may have started farther right and may not have been near the bolt's vicinity.

Falls off the crux bulge would be pretty clean~ though.    Alternately~ I was advised by one elder TP climber that the route illustrated here is actually the one called ""Crowbait"" in the 1981 guide.  That would match well with the description and rating.  But then it's not clear where the ""Crowbait Detour"" would go (how far down and left?).  Or where the original Bats in the Belfry route is located (maybe the next headwall crack to the right~ the one up and left of the Albuquerque Route anchors?).

A good sidepull allows a long reach to clip the second bolt before beginning the crux~ one of the best sequences you'll encounter at the bluff.  Reaching from a small left hand undercling~ the right is bumped up the arete until a decent pinch is found.  Smearing the right foot against a ripple in the rock~ the left is brought up to a good edge parallel with the undercling.  This position seems tailor made to generate an uncontrollable barndoor swing when the left hand is released~ but with a deep dropknee you can release your hand just long enough to make an enormous reach to a slopey pocket up high.  A few desperate bumps and you can reach a decent hold around the arete to the right~ leading to easier but still technical moves to reach the chains.  Unfortunately~ clipping the third bolt is very difficult and comes right in the middle of the crux sequence~ necessitating a horrible heelhook.  Some have chosen to skip the third bolt and climb through the crux before clipping.  This should be done with caution though~ as a large fall is risked on a very short climb~ and a grounder could occur.  Perhaps clipping the second bolt with a locking biner instead of a draw would help slightly~ and obviously an attentive belayer is a must!

It was restored by John Ross in October 2007 using the original four bolt holes. It was chopped many years ago~ becoming a casualty of a dispute between two climbers. Note that the line named Black Rose in the Ruckman guide is not the original line.    The route starts on the right side of a small bulge at the base of the slab. After getting to the top of the small bulge you clip the first bolt (14' up) and then climb through the first crux.

Continue on positive edges~ clip the fourth bolt and then bear right toward the anchor.    An alternate start is possible in the crack at the bottom left of the slab. The first bolt is a stretch but can be reached and clipped. However~ the alternate start doesn't avoid the crux~ which is after the second bolt.

Start from one of two belay locations: a single bolt if you climbed the 5.7 2nd pitch route~ or a double-bolt belay if you climbed the 5.8 2nd pitch route. While on belay~ walk across to the base of the upper wall~ praying that you dont do something stupid like trip over your shoelaces and pitch down the gully to your right.    Climb over to~ or up to~ the first bolt (depending on your start). Clip it and traverse right and slightly up to the second bolt. At this point climbing up from the second bolt would put you on Lord of the Slings. Continue traversing right and slightly up to the third bolt of Frodo Lives.  From this point head up to the fourth bolt~ then bear left for the left edge of the roof above you (following the right bolt line puts you on Shadow and Flame~ 5.10b).     The climbing to the belay anchor (located on a narrow ledge) continues through six more bolts of fairly sustained climbing; surmounting the edge of the roof and a bulge is a bit harder. Dont forget to look down!    From the belay continue up through three more bolts of thrilling climbing~ including probably the most exciting moves: getting over a small roof~ well protected by the last bolt (but you still have a lot of that I-really-dont-want-to-fall feeling because of the exposure). After topping out a two-bolt anchor is located on rock about 10 or 15 feet from the edge and on your left. There is also a shallow crack to the left of the one of the bolts in which I placed a number one BD C3 (because there was only a single bolt at the time). ","Pitch 1: 10 bolts~ hangers-and-rings anchor. I recommend slinging the first three bolts with double-length (48"") runners and the next five with regular (24"") runners This will help greatly with rope drag.

I'm probably ruining some big secret by saying that it's not at all fearsome - just lots of fun with a short approach~ good pro~ and big ledges at every belay.    Approach via the Icebox Canyon trail.  Cut over to the streambed at the confluence of the two forks of the canyon.  This is a good place to leave your packs / shoes.  Follow a faint path to an obvious flake just left of the toe of the buttress.    P1 (190'~ 5.7): Climb the right side of the flake to a bolted rap station at its top - this allows you to set a TR on the flake (about 5.5).  Continue up a thin crack (5.7) and then step left to easier ground.  Look for a tree up and left under a cracked wall and climb easily to a belay there.    P2 (160'~ 5.8): Climb up the cracked wall to another big ledge with lots of greenery.  Walk right to a left facing blocky dihedral and climb it (5.8) to a big ledge (this is the notch behind a small pinnacle).  Continue easily up and left to yet another huge ledge.    P3 (100'~ 5.5): climb an elegant chimney (5.5) until you can step left onto easy face leading to another big ledge.    P4 (120'~ 5.9): there are two cracks leading up from the ledge.  Take the right hand crack (hand / finger).  This is mostly 5.7 or so with an occasional harder move.  There is a wide section with chockstones at the top of this.  Continue to a good block and contemplate the 'offwidth' section.  This has a couple of hard moves but can be protected easily with #3 camalots.  Most of the offwidth can be avoided on the left wall.  Belay at yet another large ledge about 20' beyond the offwidth.    P5: (100'~ 5.8): climb a short wide chimney until it roofs off then swing out left (the hand traverse).  Continue up easier ground to a narrow~ evil looking slot.  Set pro and then climb down and out to the outside of the slot (just 5.5 or so) instead of putting yourself through the meatgrinder.  Above~ a big easy chimney leads left to a big pine tree.    P6: (140'~ 5.6): proceed up a fun inside corner behind the tree.  This leads to easy ground beneath the final headwall.  Climb easy huecos to a ledge beneath the obvious 5.9 crack.    P7: (60'~ 5.9): climb the varnished crack with good pro.  Things ease up considerably about 25' up.  Belay at a good ledge immediately atop the black crack.    P8: (130'~ 5.?): boulder up the wall just left of the belay or go further left to avoid this short wall and then make a run for the top on easy ground.    Descent: look for a big chockstone back and to the left from the top.  Either rap 50' or downclimb the chimney beneath the chock to easier ground - the downclimb is a lot easier than it looks from above.  Proceed along the ridge avoiding the temptation to drop off right to the upper part of the canyon - this is well cairned.  If you roughly follow the edge of the buttress you'll find a pine tree with rap slings about 60' before the ridge hits the slot where the stream runs.  Rap about 50' to a big ledge with an anchor.  From here~ a 190' rap takes you to a new bolted rap station.  There is a ledge partway down this but we didn't see an anchor on it (but we didn't look too hard).  From the bolts it's about 100' to a big ledge.  There was an anchor on the left side of the ledge that takes you 100' to the streambed.    We took about 6 hours to do the route and 2 hours to descend.  We were in the sun till around 10am.      While this route lacks the elegant line of something like Crimson or Dark Shadows~ it has a lot of fun pitches separated by big ledges.  It appears to get very little traffic even though it's very close to the road.  Check it out!

All of the chains are Fixe rap chains~ but DO NOT rap this route as flakes will EAT your rope and make for a horible trip down.      To rap off~ either climb the three bonus pitches to the summit and rap off into the gully on the west side of the summit~ or rap of Blueberry terrace via Jacobs Ladder on the east side of the terrace~ or connect with Westward Ho by rapping off the climber right side of the terrace.

This section can hold water late into the year~ so creative route finding might ensue.     At this point you have reached Blueberry Terrace. You can rap from here as described above or continue up the last three pitches. Description is as follows. Head climbers left on the ledge and traverser above the Jacob's ladder chains until you reach a small bush about 30 feet below your first bolt. At this point you should be practically around the corner above the eastern gully system.     Pitch 1 5.8 Climb up past the first bolt using gear were possible then head left and back right through a crack sytem to the first set of chains. 30M    Pitch 2 5.8 Head straight up 40 feet to the first bolt then off left and through a small gully between two larger blocks~ the chains will be directly above and to your left. 40M    Pitch 3 5.5 From here one can traverese to the ridge proper and head up~ or just pick the most appealing line that heads up to the summit through either dry or easy climbing.

Its not long~ its not difficult~ and its easy to find. I give it three stars but I do so stating ITS A BEGINNERS CLIMB. If you are looking for long~ endurance pumping splitters on your tower~ this is not it. INstead~ this climb is marked by short pitches of pleasant climbing~ a little slot canyon~ and an untramelled valley. The finish is great and there is no questioning it is a tower. It has great rock~ unique features~ and then some soft rock and some lose blocks... All stuff you will need to negotiate when tower climbing    Find the start~ and a plaque~ beneath a corner on the far right side of the formation.    P1 Climb the corner on hands and finger gear. ITs only about 30 feet to a fixed anchor on a ledge. 30 feet5.9    Proceed back in the slot about 80 feet to a crack that runs up through some huecos and a chimney on the right.    P2 Climb the crack on fingers and hand gear. Its easy~ but a little soft. The huecos are cool. Create a belay on the ledge above in the hanging valley. 45 feet~ 5.4    That pitch put you in the hanging valley. There may be an easy 5th class way down into this valley from the rim~ but you would spend a while trying to find it. Really~ the only way in is to climb.   However~ its not a private place. The Jeep Trail from Monitor and Merrimac Buttes that reaches Uranium Arch comes right to the rim above the valley. Anyway~ facing south in the little valley~ you are looking at The Seminary and the back side of The Academy. Walk about 100 feet towards the gap between the two to find the base of pitch 3    P3 Climb the hands and fingers corner to the summit ridge. The flaring pod near the base is good training~ as these come up on every tower. If you aren't comfortable with arm barring~ you might want a #5. The rap anchor is on the ledge above. 60 ft~ 5.9    To summit~ you have to climb the last 10 feet of 5.6 sans bolts... and then you have to reverse it. Also something common on towers~ but often with a harder grade attached. I spaced the summit register... hope to send one up with someone.    The descent means climbing back down to the ledge~ then rapping to the base. Its a big~ airy~ rappel. Fun.","I did the climb with two complete sets from .5 to #5. The emphasis is on finger sizes~ like 1's~ and hand sizes~ like 2.5's. If you are comfortable on those sizes you don't' need much. A #5 is useful on pitch 3 if you are uncomfortable with that size.   You need two 60 meter ropes to reach the ground safely. Its a full 192 foot rappel.",11

Do not let the 10c rating scare you away~ the crux pitch is well protected and the crux section is not long.  Because of this~ the climb may seem easier than several long climbs rated below it~ such as the Steck-Salathe and NE Buttress of Higher Cathedral.  I'd rate it harder than the East Butt of Middle Cathedral done free~ however.    Directly east of this climb is the monstrous bulk of Middle Cathedral~ with the result that this climb is surprisingly shady.  In September~ the lower portion only gets a few hours of sun a day.    The first pitch is ""only 5.8"" but is a run-out chimney which can be scary if you let it get to you.  The second pitch follows a mostly thin crack to gain a brushy ledge.  You may want to move the belay to the left after this pitch.  The next few pitches follow a left leaning~ left facing dihedral and should be obvious above you.    The third pitch starts up the dihedral with the ""Fissure Beck""~ likely named because Eric Beck was the first to free this pitch.  The base of the crack is grungy~ you can move into it from the left to avoid the first part.  The crux is about 6 inches wide~ but you can avoid offwidthing by using face holds.  Continue up to a tree~ the topo shows a belay here but due to ants you are well advised to continue for another 50 easy feet or so to a ledge.    The next pitch is the crux of the climb~ and continues up the dihedral~ which is now a weird looking flared chimney.  The crux looks potentially awkward but is a beautiful pitch which involves no chimneying.  This long pitch ends at a large terrace~ somewhat less than half way up the formation.    The first pitch above the terrace is tricky~ and several options exist (see the Reid topo).  The buttress above is somewhat lower angle and there is no distinct line~ so many different routes can be followed.  The next pitch (#8 on the Reid topo) follows a 5.6 ramp back to the left.  I believe at this point we were lured too far left up a series of giant stacked flakes (5.9).  The actual route goes more directly up (5.9)~ and continues with 3 more pitches of 5.6-5.7 to the summit.","Standard rack to #4 Camalot.

Pitch 1 (.9): Climb up the chimney to a crux move exiting the chimney. For the free version~ belay at the first anchor (atop '12 Angry Bees'). If aiding~ continue up cracks to another anchor atop 'Smokeout Ledge'.    Pitch 2 (.11c or C2+): The free variation climbs left to an overlap (crux)~ then up a scary hollow flake and thin cracks to a belay out right. The aid line either goes left out the roof (C2+ with possible pendulum point)~ or up thin cracks on the face (cam hooks and small nuts) to the same belay.    Pitch 3 (.12b/c or C2): The 'Triple Overhangs' pitch. Climb off the belay past fixed gear into a corner. Surmount the overhangs (.12 boulder problem or C2). If free climbing~ exit left out of the corner when it starts to seem blank~ then climb up and back right to the belay.    Pitch 4 (5.11a/b or C2): Climb a thin seam to a flare. Aid or free~ the crux is the initial section off the belay.    Pitch 5 (5.12d or C1): Climb a flare off the belay (5.10 or C1). Fixed pins lead over a bulge to a bolt ladder. Climb the ladder (5.12d or C1) and belay at the second of two anchors. The free crux climbs a faint flared seam. Not all the bolts can be clipped when free climbing. It is also possible to free climb right of the ladder and rejoin it higher up with a 15-20 foot runout on difficult moves in horizontals.    Pitch 6 (dirty 5th class): Join Green Drag-on for a less-than-stellar finish to the top of the wall~ or rappel the route. ","Free climbing: Nuts to #9 Black Diamond; I found brass offsets or RP's to be useful~ with doubles in the #3-5 range. A single set of cams from #0 C3/equivalent TCU's to #3 Camalot with doubles in the .4 and .5 range is more than adequate. Extra thin cams could be used~ but aren't necessary.    Aid Climbing: Cam hooks~ good nut selection with offsets~ doubles in cams from thin to #3 Camalot and possibly a #4 would cover it~ but please note that I haven't aided it lately.    If some of the pins were missing in certain spots it could change the nature of the climbing~ but my impression is that the aid would probably still be clean~ especially with modern gadgetry.",17

It has the distinction of being established in a single-day first ascent by noted NC climber Jeep Gaskin and his wife Julia -- on their honeymoon!  For much of its length~ Groover follows a nice arching crack system with great protection; toward the top~ it uses the carved water grooves that are a hallmark of Laurel Knob.  Don't let the 5.8 rating or the fact that there's ""only"" six pitches fool you; this is a long and committing climb with serious runouts on the upper pitches.  Start early and bring plenty of water.    For anyone wanting to experience North Carolina climbing at its finest~ Groover is not to be missed.    P1 - starting at a large pine tree~ climb a right-facing crack system up and slightly left to a ledge with another pine tree and belay (NOTE: this pine is the only place to bail without leaving gear until you reach the end of the fifth pitch).  5.7+~ 190'   P2 - Move right from the tree and continue up a left-facing crack that will merge into the arching crack system that is Groover's main feature.  Follow this for another full rope length and find a comfortable spot to build a gear anchor and belay.  5.7~ 190'   P3 - Continue up the arching crack to a steep bulge; tiptoe over the bulge to the right and onto a sloping platform that makes a comfortable belay station.  5.7~ 180'   P4 - Prepare yourself mentally for climbing high above your protection.  From the belay~ climb high into the crack and place a medium-to-large cam~ then downclimb until you can move out right on a bulge with quartz dikes for footing.  Continue traversing right about 30' to reach the second of two deep water grooves~ then look for gear before heading up (there's supposed to be a distinctive quartz hole in the groove somewhere).  Head up the groove for about 100' or so (you may find a gear placement along the way)~ until you reach some spacious solution pockets and a welcome crack to build an anchor.  5.8~ 160'  NOTE:  If you were doing the Fischesser variation~ you'd continue up the arching crack from here.   P5 - Move left about 15' to the obvious continuing groove; climb this steeper groove past three bolts and one good pro placement in a finger pocket.  Finish at a narrow tree ledge with a bolt just below.  5.8+~ 100'   P6 - Continue up on easier ground and arc out right to an obvious tree island for a full rope length; after bringing up your second~ continue to the right end of the tree island and look for a bolted rap station (the top of P6 on the Groover Fischesser finish).  5.6~ 200' ","Bring a full rack of active and passive pro; cams up to 4"" are useful/necessary.

It's full of great moves~ airy postions~ fiddley gear~ and exciting runouts.  The only two detractors from this being a neo-classic are that the second and third pitches feel ever so slightly contrived (although the climbing is still very good) and the fact that Mike Tupper's homemade hangers seem quite dubious.    The climb starts right off of the water pools at the base of the Dark Shadows wall.  It's worth taking some time to identify the correct line:  There are four routes that take off from this area~ each with two bolts up the water-polished slab.  The right-most one~ with nice modern hangers~ departs from the boulder above the waterfall and is the famous Dark Shadows.  Next is Sandstone Sandwich~ which is best approached by traversing in from the boulder.  It has modern hangers as well.  The next one is Excellent Adventure which currently has homemade hangers.  Finally~ the left-most is Risky Business.  All of these bolts can be hard to pick out without careful inspection.    P1:  Step onto some rocks and then up onto the face immediately below the homemade hangers.  You are aiming for the right end of a white roof about 75' up.  Climb the slab easily to the second bolt~ then perform a difficult move (5.10) past this bolt and continue up to the edge of the roof.  Pull the roof a few feet left of the right edge onto a steep face and a tips crack of sorts.  Climb up past a bolt or two until you can trend left into an easy right-diagonalling crack system.  Follow this to a spacious belay ledge that gives good views of Dark Shadows.    P2:  Step directly left off the belay around the blunt arete and up to a bolt.  Swain's description speaks of down climbing but this is unnecessary.  Climb up to a second bolt (tough move immediately before the clip) then head almost straight left to easier ground.  The moves left from this bolt are the crux of the climb and check in at about 5.11b/c (this section felt slightly contrived as the bolts force you to avoid easier~ more obvious climbing).  Continue up past more bolts to easier climbing.  The rock here is steep and the gear spacing is sporty!  Right when things get blank again you can step left around a blunt arete to the anchor.  Do not step left too soon and do not belay at the nice modern-bolted station that is a part of Risky Business.    P3:  This is the psychological crux of the route - great climbing but a lot of 5.10 moves way out from gear.  Contrary to Swain's description~ this is not scary for the second at all (solid TR the whole time) - definately put the cool-headed leader on this pitch.  Also~ the scale/proportions in his topo for this pitch are way off: it would appear in the topo that there are only four bolts (instead of five) and that after you clip the last one you head straight left for a long ways.  In actuality~ after you clip the last bolt~ you go straight up for a long ways~ and you don't have to go all that far left to reach the anchor.  Here's the description:  Climb up off the belay past four bolts with homemade hangers.  The line of bolts trend out right over the huge Heart of Darkness roof.  The fourth clip is a tough one.  From here you'll see an old stud out right (ignore this)~ and an obvious 5th bolt directly above.  Head up to this fifth bolt.  Take a deep breath and punch it for 30+ feet of 5.10 climbing straight up the face to a horn and overlap (alternatively~ it is possible to clip the 5th bolt~ then downclimb a move or two then head almost directly right (5.10+/5.11- moves) 15' to a huge hole in the rock.  From here climb up about 10-20'~ then traverse back left along a natural line of holds until you are directly above (by 15-20 feet or so) the 5th bolt again.  Continue up to the aformentioned horn and overlap ).  Load the overlap up with thank-God gear and get a good shake~ then continue straight up on more neat 5.10 climbing past several RP placements.  After about 20 feet you'll see the angle of the face eases off - pull up onto a ledge system and walk a few feet to your left to the Risky Business/Excellent Adventure anchors.    Yee Haw!  What a route!","Single set of cams to 0.75 Camalot~ a #1 Camalot is helpful in a few places.  Extra micro gear - small Aliens are extremely useful.  Small & medium wires~ RP's~ HB offsets helpful.

Most routes to which this moniker is added may seem insignificant compared to the SE Face of Lotus Flower Tower. The route climbs perfect alpine granite for 18 pitches to an amazing summit.    The climb is all about uniformity. The first three pitches climb a well-defined left facing corner. The next five or six pitches climb a long chimney. Then~ the fun starts. After a short left facing corner~ the last ten pitches or so climb cracks and knobs on the exposed and narrowing face.      Pitch 1: Climb a left-facing corner to a fixed belay. 5.8    Pitch 2: Continue up this corner to a fixed belay 5.9    Pitch 3: Follow the corner until it's end and exit right~ skirting below a large roof. This pitch is often wet~ but when dry~ the exit moves feel about 5.10a.    Pitch 4: Since you are on the face now~ wander up the face to the base of a long chimney. 5.7    Pitches 5-9: Climb up the 5.7 chimney. The chimney is long but secure. It's possible and advisable to simul-climb this section~ especially if you're doing the route in a day.     Pitch 10: Wander up and right to a large ledge. This ledge is big enough to park a school bus on~ well~ probably a short bus. 5.8 This ledge is an excellent bivy~ as it's totally flat.     Pitch 11: Climb a big left facing corner~ 5.9+~ to an amazing small ledge at the very edge of the face.     Pitches 12-15: Follow parallel cracks up the face of the tower. Though you protect in the cracks~ the preponderance of strange diorite knobs encourages face climbing. There are many ways to ascend this section. Just follow knobs to the base of an unmistakable roof. 5.9    Pitch 16: Climb past the obvious three-foot roof. This move is easily aided~ making the route 5.10 C1. Otherwise~ expect a 5.11- pull past the route. This move is much more difficult than any other move on the route. It is possible to traverse right and climb a splitter hand crack through the roof~ but this may present its own set of problems. Sustained 5.9 cracks lead up to the belay.    Pitches 17 and 18: Gradually widening cracks lead to the summit. The last pitch contains some 5.8 offwidth climbing~ but it's really not too bad.    Descent: Rap the route. The upper part of the route has fixed belay stations~ so rapping is straightforward (just be careful about snagging your rope on the knobs). Once you reach the ledge~ the rap route diverges from the climbing route and heads down the face. There is a serious epic potential here as the stations are tough to find on the big face.  Stay out of the chimney at all costs. I know. If you end up rapping back into the chimney~ you're in for a long and slow descent as your rope gets hung up on every possible feature.

It is varied~ steep~ long and challenging with perfect rock. This route has some great crack climbing but the real excitement comes from the reasonably bolted face sections. The exposure is fantastic and the whole route is well protected.  History: A ""Turkey"" was a name given to someone who did not conform to the purist climbing standards~ see in dictionary under ""Kook."" Jorge and Joanne politely responded to their given titles by self-professing and naming the route ""Dream of Wild Turkeys.""  DOWT is deservedly very popular and given the fact that it shares the first pitch with the equally popular Prince of Darkness (5.10c)~ an early start is highly recommended.  There are many other options on this wall and in this area if this route is jammed. Sour Mash is another good option on BV Wall and a few variations of DOTW exist also: Yellow Brick Road is a 5.10b 2-pitch direct variation beginning on the third pitch~ and The Gobbler is a 5.10a variation to the start.  To approach~ follow the stream bed until a large wall blocks the way. Here~ you should be directly across from the large arch on the lower right side of the wall. At this point~ follow a faint ""trail"" up left to fourth class terrain and scramble up this~ aiming for the left side of the arch. Take the trail to a rocky terrace on the left of the arch. Locate a nice right angling crack about a pitch up. The bottom of this crack is the top of the first pitch.  P1: Climb nebulous 5.6 terrain aiming for the bottom of the crack on P2. Belay at 2 bolts about 100' up. The pro on this pitch is somewhat sparse but the climbing is easier than anything else on the route.  P2: 5.9~ ~160' Make a few thin moves off the belay up and right and gain the crack. There are lots of slabular moves on this pitch due to the angling nature. The crack eats stoppers. Follow this crack to another double-bolt belay.  P3: 5.9~ 100' Continue up the crack until a line of bolts leads to the right. Continuing straight up puts you on Yellow Brick Road. Check out the plaque. Make the exciting traverse right clipping 4 or 5 bolts on your way. This is steep here but the holds are big. Once you gain the large crack~ make some 5.8 offwidth moves up another 30' to another 2 bolt belay on your right. If you miss the belay~ which is hard to spot~ another possible~ albeit uncomfortable~ belay can be had a little further up.  P4: 5.10a~ 150' Continue up the crack to it's top. The crack becomes thinner and thinner until it's gone. At the top~ two strangely placed bolts mark the crux of the pitch and the climb. Make a few very thin moves out left aiming for the bolted belay.  P5: 5.10a~ Exciting pitch! Follow the line of bolts up and left on tiny edges and belay at another set of bolts at the base of a cresent shaped corner.  P6: 5.9~ 130' Follow the cresent corner up and right. It starts out shallow and easy and gets steeper and harder near its top. Step onto the face and make some bolt-protected moves up and left to a thin crack. Follow this bolted crack up to another bolted belay.  P7: 5.8~ 120' Follow the thin crack straight up. Near the top~ the angle rolls off and easy climbing leads to a large ledge with belay/rap bolts.  Most people rap from here as we did~ although the route continues up for another 4 pitches which are suppose to be good.  For the descent from here~ make a series of double-rope raps down the wall. Staying a little left on POD is the best option if noone is coming up as there are fewer rope-eating cracks there~ although rapping down DOWT and Yellow Brick Road works fine too. We did it in 5 raps.","Standard rack to 3""~ some quick draws~ std. and a few long runners.",566

Figure out how to pull up off the ground to a chalked-up tooth and then get to a crack where a .5 camalot previously protected steep moves. Now a couple of bolts protect it. Continue up on nicely featured face and crack climbing passing a number of bolts as the crack gets wider (fist size) and steeper. You don't need crack skills~ however~ as there are plenty of nice features to grasp along the way.     This route was initially climbed on gear and rated 5.11b by the FA party. Consensus suggests it's easier and in the spring of 2011 the route was bolted by an unknown party and a anchor added so gear is no longer necessary. The gear was pretty marginal and this is a very fun line so it sees quite a bit more traffic now with the bolts.  It's not clear whether or not the bolter tried contacting the FA party or even realized this was an established line (although given the length~ fun moves and busy location~ one should have suspected it had been climbed previously.)","9 bolts to its own anchor with steel carabiners on chain.

The pitches end on huge ledges with bolted anchors. The faces all go with pretty reasonable protection.  Pitch 1 (5.6) Head up aiming for a large ledge over easy blocky terrain (5.4) and gain the face. I wouldn't suggest placing too much on this first bit or the rope drag will be somewhat unbearable later. Head up the face through many small cracks and huge jugs. The bolts are on the left right as you top out. You can scramble off the right side from here if you don't wish to climb any further. If wishing to continue scramble along the top of the rib to the base of the next pitch.  Pitch 2 (5.6) Head up following the large crack that takes great gear and is a super enjoyable romp. Anchors are on the left or the right when you top out this pitch. To continue onto pitch three head to the back of the rib and either rappel or downscramble to the base of the next rib. You can rappel off the right side to escape from the top of this rib.  Pitch 3 (5.6) Climb on the right side of the formation aiming for a small tree. Set up a belay here and belay the second up this very short pitch. Mostly done simply to set up for the last pitch and to avoid rope drag.  Pitch 4 (5.8) Climb up a few feet and then step out onto the face. Climb to the top using the various features. More difficult to protect than the former pitches this last one is skipped by many just looking for a warmup/romp.
